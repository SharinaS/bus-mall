# Bus Mall
A web application built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, that makes use of a JavaScript library called chart.js. An event listener and an event handler is also used within the code. The page shows three pictures that a user can click on. Each time a user clicks on an image,the selection of pictures randomly changes, with the stipulation that no picture is duplicated during a viewing, and that every picture that is shown, cannot have been one that just appeared. With every click, the number of clicks are tallied up, along with the number of times that a image is viewed. Each user adds to the overall collection of data, using local storage. The local storage is only refreshed when the developer chooses. At the end of each user's voting session, 25 clicks, the data is used to populate graphs and charts from the collection of data in the local storage for easier analysis at the bottom of the page.
